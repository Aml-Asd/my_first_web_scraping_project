Amazon Price Tracker

This is a Python web scraping project that tracks the price of a product on Amazon Egypt. The script extracts the product's title and price, stores the data in a CSV file, and updates it periodically.

Features

âœ… Scrapes product title and price from Amazon Egypt.âœ… Saves the extracted data into a CSV file.âœ… Prevents duplicate entries.âœ… Runs continuously to track price changes.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

How It Works

The script sends a request to the Amazon product page.

It extracts the product title and price using BeautifulSoup.

The data is saved in a CSV file (AmazonWebScraperDataset.csv).

The script runs in a loop to check the price every few seconds.

Usage

Run the script using:

python amazon_price_tracker.py
